# README

This is a personal website I began in June 2021. This is my first real try at full web development on my own. I want to incorporate some cools designs/components, learn a lot, and provide some interesting content. I am spending the summer making the website better and improving it so forgive me there are bugs. Similarly, the site can change pretty quickly as I am always making changes. Currently, its React on the frontend and Ruby on Rails on the backend, but I am working on switching over to using Django as I know Python much better than Ruby and I want to explore what Django had to offer. However, I am having issues deploying on Heroku with Django, so we'll see how long this transition takes.
